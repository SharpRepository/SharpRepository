IMPORTANT
It is important that your application or development environment use the same assemblies as the cache servers. During any upgrade of the distributed cache system, make sure that all cache clients using that system have the same versions of the assemblies. Check this by comparing the product version of the cache client's Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.Client.dll file with the product version of the cache server's Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.Server.dll file located in the installation folder.
